## 📌 Introduction

Pregnancy is a delicate phase, and continuous fetal heart monitoring is essential to ensure the well-being of both mother and baby and to ensure speedy treatment in case of complications. In many rural regions, pregnant women do not have access to healthcare clinics or fetal monitoring devices. This leads to delayed detection of fetal distress and avoidable complications.

**GarbhSurakhsha** is a low-cost, AI-powered fetal heart monitoring system designed to:

* Monitor fetal heart rate in real time
* Provide villages with a cost-friendly healthcare solution
* Detect abnormal heart rhythms automatically
* Alert caregivers instantly in case of danger
* Make fetal monitoring accessible, especially in underserved areas

This project combines **signal processing, artificial intelligence, and computational thinking** to create a safe, reliable, and affordable maternal healthcare solution.

## ❗ Problem Statement

In many rural and underserved regions, pregnant women do not have regular access to clinics or advanced fetal monitoring systems. As a result, fetal heart abnormalities such as irregular rhythms often go undetected until it is too late, leading to preventable complications, emergency deliveries, or even fetal loss.

Current monitoring methods require clinical settings, trained professionals, and costly equipment, making regular fetal health tracking impossible for most families. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a **portable, low-cost, AI-powered fetal heart monitoring system** that can detect early signs of fetal distress and alert caregivers in real time.

Maternal health is also a key indicator of the **Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)**.

## ⚙️ Concept & Working

**GarbhSurakhsha** captures fetal heart sounds and processes them using an AI model to classify readings as **normal** or **abnormal**, which can be viewed through a mobile application.

### 🔄 Working Flow

1. **Signal Capture**

   * A microphone attached to a stethoscope captures fetal heart sounds.
   * The microphone connects directly to a smartphone using an audio jack.
   * The recorded audio is sent to the phone for analysis.

2. **AI-Based Analysis**
   A TensorFlow-based AI model analyzes features such as:

   * Heart Rate (BPM)
   * Heart Rate Variability
   * Rhythm patterns

3. **Alert System**

   * Real-time alerts are sent to caregivers via a dedicated mobile app when abnormalities are detected.

## 🧪 Scientific Principles

### ❤️ Normal Heart Rate Calculation

* Normal fetal heart rate: **110–160 BPM**
* Detection of:

  * **Tachycardia:** >160 BPM
  * **Bradycardia:** <110 BPM

### ⏱️ Rhythm Regularity

* Identification of irregular spacing between consecutive heartbeats

### 🤖 Machine Learning Classification

* AI model trained on fetal heart rate patterns
* Classifies heart rhythms as **normal** or **abnormal**
